Reminder Bot
Just add reminder@asheesh.in to your friendlist in gmail and start using the service. To start just type 'hi' or 'help'.

How to use:
The possible ways of using it are:
   1. remind <time> <message>
   2. remind rec <count> <time> <message>
The first one is for one time reminders and second one for recursive reminders.


<time> can be either [0-9]<sec|min|hour> or <absolute time>

e.g.

    * remind 10hour pay phone bill   ---- It will remind you after 10hours to pay your phone bill
    * remind 20:00 book movie ticket   --- reminds you to book ticket at 8PM
    * remind rec 5 11:00 project meeting     --- reminds you at 11AM for next 5days for project meeting
